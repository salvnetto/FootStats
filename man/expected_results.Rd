\title{Compare Expected vs Actual Results}
\usage{
expected_results(df, favorite = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing match results and predictions. Same structure as required for score().}

\item{favorite}{Character specifying favorite team filtering:
\itemize{
\item "home" - Filter matches where home team was predicted favorite
\item "away" - Filter matches where away team was predicted favorite
\item NULL (default) - No filtering, use all matches
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item result (character) - Match outcomes
\item real_result (integer) - Count of actual outcomes
\item expected_result (numeric) - Sum of predicted probabilities
}
}
\description{
Analyzes model performance by comparing predicted probabilities with actual outcomes.

\examples{
# Create proper test data
test_data <- data.frame(
  result = c("W", "D", "L", "W", "D"),
  home_win = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3),
  home_lost = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.4),
  draw = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3)
)

# Run with actual data
expected_results(test_data, favorite = "home")
}
