\title{Calculate Model Performance Score}
\usage{
score(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing match results and predictions. Must contain columns:
\itemize{
\item result (character) - Match outcomes with values "W", "D", or "L"
\item home_win (numeric) - Predicted probability of home win
\item draw (numeric) - Predicted probability of draw
\item home_lost (numeric) - Predicted probability of home loss
}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the numeric score value. Prints formatted message with score.

\description{
Computes a weighted performance score based on match outcomes and predicted probabilities.

# Create sample data
